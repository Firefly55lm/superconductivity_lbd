# INFERENTIAL ANALYSIS OF THE CRITICAL TEMPERATURE IN SUPERCONDUCTORS


## ABSTRACT
This repository contains and analysis carried on for academic purposes, related to Big Data analysis infrastructures and techniques.
The main goal is to infer the relationship between the critical temperature of a supercondutor material and its molecular structer,
in terms of both atomic characteristics and elements of composition. The analysis consists in the usage of machine learning models from
the pyspark library, simulating the computation on a fictitious computer cluster based on Docker containers.

## DATASET
Data source: ["Superconductivity Data"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/464/superconductivty+data) from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)

The dataset contains 21263 occurrences, representing different superconductor materials. It's divided in the following two csv files:
- superconductivity.csv: data about the atomic characteristics of the material (renamed from train.csv)
- molec_structure.csv: data about the quantities of every element from the periodic table (renamed from unique.csv)
You can find both csv into the 'data' directory of this repository, but i suggest you to download them from the original source linked upward.
